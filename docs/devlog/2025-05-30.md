#  📏 Measurement

At this stage of the project, the focus shifts toward measurement — both in terms of functional correctness and performance.

## 🎯 Measurement Goals

### 1️⃣ Functional Correctness

- Q: Are the promised features working?
- Q: Have we accidentally broken anything (regressions)?

### 2️⃣ Performance

- Q: What are the critical bottlenecks affecting the perception of product quality?
- Q: Why are users not staying on the platform?

## 🛠️ Current Context

At this stage, the project reflects what you’d expect from a small engineering team (< 5 engineers).
Speed of development is prioritized over polish — technical debt is expected.

As the product matures toward POC → MVP → first users, the ability to fix issues quickly becomes critical.

## 🎨 Testing Philosophy

Maximize value for effort:

- Focus on testing public interfaces (REST APIs) only.
- No need to test internal functions or database internals at this stage.
- The current test environment will consist of:
  - The service container
  - The Postgres container

## 📊 Metrics Philosophy

Performance issues often affect users without being outright bugs:

- Queries per second spikes.
- Unreasonably Slow APIs. (P99 > 500ms)
- Increasing error rates under load.
- Underprovisioning.

We want to intentionally clamp down on metrics and thresholds. The only value is improving focus. Too many metrics
and ambitious thresholds can do the opposite. Metrics should guide data-driven insights:

- How many user queries does the system receive every second?
- What’s the slowest query?
- Which services are resource starved?
  - Which resources are these?
- What should we optimize first?

## 🏆 Summary

- 🎯 Focus: Functional correctness and performance
- 🧠 Strategy: Integration tests against public REST APIs
- 🥅 Goal: Visualize
- 💰 Tradeoff: Some technical debt is acceptable. Priority is moving fast, recording bugs, measuring performance,
     preventing regressions and deliberate optimizations.
