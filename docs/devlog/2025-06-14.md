# Deploying Grafana, Prometheus & Cert-Manager using Helmfile

Today I set up a production-grade monitoring stack using [**Helmfile**](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile); a declarative tool that simplifies managing Helm charts. Here's what I learned along the way.

## ðŸ”§ Why Helmfile?

Helmfile is like `docker-compose` for Kubernetes Helm charts. It lets you:

- Define your Helm releases in one file
- Handle multiple environments
- Apply secrets securely using [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops)
- Run `helmfile apply` to sync everything to your cluster

## ðŸš€ My Monitoring Stack

I used Helmfile to install:

- **Cert-Manager** for automated TLS certification.
- **Prometheus** for metrics
- **Grafana** for dashboards

First pass I used `direnv` with a local .env to supply secrets.

1. Created a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret
   ```

2. Created a .envrc file for direnv:
    ```
    source .env
    ```

3. Helmfile loaded the secret using:
    ```
    set:
    - name: adminPassword
      value: {{ requiredEnv "GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD" }}
    ```

We can easily maintain this secret on Github and bootstrap clustes via git-ops.
[sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) was also considered. It requires storing the private key reliably and allows
users to commit secrets. I am not fluent in workflows that make this conveniently safe i.e. fumbling a few steps can 
leak secrets.
