# Possible mount regression with 2.41 when using Kubernetes

That's the title of [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/3474). I ran into this today trying to get my o11y stack up on a k3s cluster.

## Symptom

Using my [helmfile config](https://github.com/ltbringer/level-scale/tree/main/infra/cluster/dev/helm), running

```bash
helmfile apply
```

installs the charts, but inspecting the pod with `kubectl describe pod $POD` shows:

```text
  Normal   Scheduled  2m  default-scheduler  Successfully assigned o11y/grafana-567dcc58bc-tgjzx to k3s-agent-fsn1-sm-imw
  Warning  Failed     2m  kubelet            Error: failed to generate container "137552c3966460750d9a6ce2150405406aad634b71594f73272e7cb4beae9e0a" spec: failed to generate spec: failed to mkdir "/var/lib/kubelet/pods/a8c40583-a42f-43a5-9c08-7bdcbceea005/volume-subpaths/config/grafana/0": mkdir /var/lib/kubelet/pods/a8c40583-a42f-43a5-9c08-7bdcbceea005/volume-subpaths/config/grafana/0: file exists
  Warning  Failed     2m  kubelet            Error: failed to prepare subPath for volumeMount "config" of container "grafana"
```

### Two key errors

1. A stale directory created by kubelet’s *subPath* logic.
2. `kubelet` cannot bind‑mount the `ConfigMap` file because the path is busy.

## First attempts at cleanup

I assumed a race condition and tried `helmfile destroy && helmfile apply`, but the error returned every time.

Next, I checked the node:

```bash
mount | grep grafana
proc on /var/lib/kubelet/pods/d67cfc1d-.../volume-subpaths/config/grafana/0 type proc (...)
proc on /var/lib/kubelet/pods/0b720a79-.../volume-subpaths/config/grafana/0 type proc (...)
proc on /var/lib/kubelet/pods/41e5cf28-.../volume-subpaths/config/grafana/0 type proc (...)
```

and manually unmounted them:

```bash
sudo umount /var/lib/kubelet/pods/<uid>/volume-subpaths/config/grafana/0
```

If a pod from the previous run still existed, the directory was locked and `rm -rf ...` failed with *Device or resource busy*.

A full

```bash
helmfile destroy && sudo umount ...
```

cleared the mounts, **but the next **``** reproduced the error**.

## Root cause

### 1. Helm chart behaviour

Grafana Helm chart **9.x** mounts a single file from a `ConfigMap` using

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: config
    mountPath: /etc/grafana/grafana.ini
    subPath: grafana.ini
```

This triggers kubelet’s *subPath* path on every pod start. If the container crashes before the bind‑mount completes,
kubelet leaves a **dangling **``** mount** under `volume-subpaths/…/grafana/0`.

### 2. Kubelet bug (kubernetes/kubernetes[#61178](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/61178))

This bug is old. If a bind-mount fails mid‑way, kubelet doesn’t always clean it up. 
That leftover mount blocks future pods on the same node.

### 3. **util-linux 2.41 regression**

This was the critical new piece: [util-linux/util-linux#3474](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/issues/3474) introduced a regression in the mount command’s 
handling of file-descriptor mounts. 

#### What broke exactly?
Kubelet uses subPath, which internally calls 

```
mount --bind --no-canonicalize. 
```
When this reaches libmount, `open_tree()` syscall is used the flag `AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW` is set 
and that flag only makes sense when a path is provided. In case of FD the path is `""`. So:

1. Kubelet wants to bind-mount a file (subPath)
2. libmount breaks the open_tree call
3. The mount never completes
4. So we have a `dir` on the host / node but was never mounted. The path exists in the filesystem only.
5. Kubelet retries and this time it fails because the path exists.

#### Workaround

Downgrading to util‑linux **2.40.x** is the known workaround.

> [!NOTE]
> The issue already has a [fix,](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/pull/3479) but it is awaiting release.

## Fix: Downgrade

In `packer-template/hcloud-microos-snapshots.pkr.hcl` modify the **install\_packages** step:

```bash
transactional-update --continue shell <<- EOF
zypper install --oldpackage -y \
  https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Base:/System/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64/util-linux-2.40.4-1.1.x86_64.rpm
zypper addlock util-linux
EOF
```

Rebuild snapshots: new nodes boot with `util‑linux-2.40.4` and the bug disappears even if subPath is present. (unconfirmed)
